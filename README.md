# Dog breed project

This is a group project where we created a web app that helps you learn more about dog breeds.

## Features

- The app has a page that displays a list of dog breeds, so user can memorise the names of all the breeds.
- When you click one of the breeds on the doglist page, you can see a page that shows 10 pictures of that breed.
- The app has 3 games: 
  - The first game shows the user a random picture of a dog and it asks the user to choose the correct breed name from a list of 3 options. 
  - The second game shows the user the name of a breed and 3 images of dogs. User must select the correct image that matches the breed name.
  - The third game combines the first two games: sometimes it shows a picture and 3 breednames and sometimes it shows a breedname and 3 pictures.
- The game keeps track of user's performance and displays a success rate (in percentages) on the page.

## Technologies
